This is my submission for the Game Off 2024. This is my second game jam attempt (did not submit on time for first). Game Off was a month long game jam and had the theme of "Secrets". Through the game and feedback, I learned to create a Tile-based RPG and how to impliment various upgrades for the player. Next time I do a game jam, I will ensure that I will use more formal language within my game and to make the combat more 'dynamic' and responsive.

## "Game for pre calc teacher"

This was more of a 'joke' game for 'Lellympics'. Even so, it showcases my experience in creating platformer games.
