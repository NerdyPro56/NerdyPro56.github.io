## Secrets of the Spell ("Game Off 2024")

This is my submission for the Game Off 2024. This is my second game jam attempt (did not submit on time for first). Game Off was a month long game jam and had the theme of "Secrets". Through the game and feedback, I learned to create a Tile-based RPG and how to impliment various upgrades for the player. Next time I do a game jam, I will ensure that I will use more formal language within my game and to make the combat more 'dynamic' and responsive.

## "Game for pre calc teacher"

This was more of a 'joke' game for 'Lellympics'. Even so, it showcases my experience in creating platformer games.
